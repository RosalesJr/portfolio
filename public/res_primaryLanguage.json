      "description": "My name is Luis Rosales.I’m an Outbound Maintenance Supervisor in the US. Army. I’m currently studying Advanced Software Development in Full-Stack JavaScript at Code Fellows. Code Fellows has been challenging but being in the US Army taught me how to overcome challenges and become a problem solver. I’ve always loved tech, but my passion for coding first arose when I started studying Python as a self taught developer. Watching how I could create amazing applications out of code is second to none for me.  I gained some months’ programming experience during my studies, but am now looking to gain more experience, hopefully as a junior level developer. If the opportunity knocks I am open to internships or software developer positions at SMEs in the technology sector. I believe the skills the Army has given me can make me a valuable asset to your team.",
